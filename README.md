# WOT Onslaught â€” Availability Voting (React)

This is a minimal React + Vite app connected using Node.js and mongo to let players vote which days they're available for Onslaught (World of Tanks).

Quick start (PowerShell on Windows):

```powershell
cd d:\Coding\Hokx\HokxOnslaught
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (typically http://localhost:5173) to view the app.

Note: the backend is stored here: https://github.com/DaniilSsv/HokxBackend.git
